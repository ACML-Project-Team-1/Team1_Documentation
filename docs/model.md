# Model - CNN

## Describe the model

A Convolutional neural network was implemented as it does a good job at working with image data classification.

### Define the model

### Train the model

The amount of epochs the model needs to be trained for is defined. The training data is split into its label and data. Forward propagation is done, the loss is calculated and backpropagation is done. Afterwards, weights are tuned. The model gets saved into a reusable state.

## Python Libraries 

Pytorch was used in addition to torch vision to define layers and preprocess and transform the data.
